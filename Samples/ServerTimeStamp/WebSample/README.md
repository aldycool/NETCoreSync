The server-side .NET Core Server that uses `NETCoreSyncServer` middleware to serve synchronization feature for Flutter clients (uses the `netcoresync_moor` package, located in the clientsample folder). This example is implemented in .NET 5, and uses Entity Framework Core + PostgreSQL as the central database for all data synchronization.
